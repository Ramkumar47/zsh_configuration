# zsh_configuration
personal z shell configuration

## notes of installation and configuration
  * install zsh from repository and follow *arch wiki* to make it default.
  * install **oh my zsh** by following instructions on their website.
  * then copy the theme and bashrc to the **$ZSH/themes/** and home directory respectively.
  * install **zsh-syntax-highlighting** pack from repository and source it (by default it is sourced in zshrc file itself)

## note as per present understanding
  * the PROMPT color and shortcuts are taken from oh-my-zsh configuration automatically.
  * the foreground and background of commands typed on terminal is only configured by URxvt configurations, so does other terminal options like transparency.
  * the foreground and background colors like on pacman search are governed by URxvt configurations only.

## future upgrades.
  * respective font configurations. font can be installed from **powerline fonts** by following thier github repository.
